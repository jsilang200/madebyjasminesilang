	<p>
	Hi there! My name is Jasmine Silang, and I am a graphic designer based in Toronto, Canada. I am currently a second year student studying Graphic Design at George Brown College: School of Design and social media manager / designer at Real Fruit Bubble Tea.

	<br>
	<br>
	I have strong capabilities in typography, page layout, digital illustration, concept development, and image retouching.

	<br>
	<br>
	Some of my related achievements include the Friesens Yearbook Design Award - 2018, as well as being Notre Dame CSS's Yearbook Editor in Chief - 2017/2018.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	I am an overall creative individual with a passion for design, continuously looking for ways to grow and improve my skills.
